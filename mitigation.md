# Methods to mitigate this attack

Some measures to mitigate this attack are the following:
*	Enabling the Smartphoneâ€™s operating system to warn and notify the user before the output of the display, while connected the phones through VGA/HDMI cables.
*	Using safe USB devices such as USB condoms which when you used to connect to an external charger can prevent data leakages, where the output from the USB device has access only to the power lines ![USB Condom](/img/Usb_con.jpg)
*	Use of biometric impressions to unlock the phone can prevent some key secrets such as phone unlock pins being revealed.
*   Another simpler alternative is to carry your own charger.
