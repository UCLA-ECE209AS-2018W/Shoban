# Abstract

Usage of Smartphones has become highly common in recent days, so much so that it has become a part of the lifestyle for many, without which there day would be miserable. With the increase use of smartphones the challenges to maintain the privacy of Smart phone users has increased. A number of malware attacks such as [Soundcomber\[3\]](/references.md), [Screenmilker\[2\]](/references.md), have been spread. These attacks are either based on physical access or through malwares injected into the device through the network.

This project demonstrates an attack where the smartphone screen is recorded on connecting to a tampered unauthorized charger. The screen recording is further processed to obtain the unlock password of a Smartphone. The stealthiness of this attack depends on how invisible is this to the user. There exists a vulnerability in smart phones which support screen sharing through cables which can be utilized to make this attack invisible. 

The vulnerability exploited in this attack is that when a MHL/HDMI supported smartphone (Android/iOS) is connected to a projector through a HDMI/VGA cable, there are no permission requests or authentication steps required for connectivity. The projector automatically screens the phone on connection. 

This vulnerability was spotted and exploited in a paper called **“Charging Me and I Know Your Secrets! Towards Juice Filming Attacks on Smartphones” \[[1](/references.md)\] In Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security, pp. 89-98. ACM, 2015. This project is a demonstration of the attack explained in the aforementioned paper, which is then extended to extract the unlock passwords from the video recordings.

This project aims at creating an awareness about the risk of charging phones in public charging booths which could be tampered to record your phone.
